I am Shivani Bathla, a PhD graduate from the [Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras](http://ee.iitm.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. Vinita Vasudevan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/vinita/). My research work primarily involved developing algorithms for approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models and exploring the use of these models to solve problems in digital circuit design and discrete optimization problems.  Prior to PhD, I obtained my M.S. (by research) degree from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) and B.Tech. from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/).

**Research Interests**: Automated reasoning, Optimization,  Sampling and belief propagation based algorithms, Causal inference, Graph representation learning, Machine learning for circuit design and electronic design automation, Hardware accelerators
