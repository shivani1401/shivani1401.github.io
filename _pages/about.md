I am Shivani Bathla, a PhD graduate from the [Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras](http://ee.iitm.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. Vinita Vasudevan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/vinita/). Prior to PhD, I received my M.S. (by research) degree from [IIT, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) and B.Tech. from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/).

<!-- My research work primarily involved developing algorithms for approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models and exploring the use of these models to solve problems in digital circuit design and discrete optimization problems. -->
